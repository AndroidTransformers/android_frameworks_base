<p><em>API Level:</em> <b>Honeycomb</b></p>

<p>For developers, the Android 3.0 preview is available as a downloadable component for the
Android SDK.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Read the <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/preview/start.html">Getting Started</a> guide for important information
about setting up your development environment and limitiations of the Android 3.0 preview.</p>







<h2 id="#api">API Overview</h2>

<p>The sections below provide a technical overview of what's new for developers in Android 3.0,
including new features and changes in the framework API since the previous version.</p>


<h3>Fragments</h3>

<p>A fragment is a new framework component that allows you to separate distinct elements of an
activity into self-contained modules that define their own UI and lifecycle. To create a
fragment, you must extend the {@link android.app.Fragment} class and implement several lifecycle
callback methods, similar to an {@link android.app.Activity}. You can then combine multiple
fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI in which each
pane manages its own lifecycle and user inputs.</p>

<p>You can also use a fragment without providing a UI and instead use the fragment as a worker
for the activity, such as to manage the progress of a download that occurs only while the
activity is running.</p>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fragments are self-contained and can be reused in multiple activities</li>
  <li>Fragments can be added, removed, replaced and animated inside the activity</li>
  <li>Fragment can be added to a back stack managed by the activity, preserving the state of
fragments as they are changed and allowing the user to navigate backward through the different
states</li>
  <li>By <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#AlternativeResources">providing
alternative layouts</a>, you can mix and match fragments, based
on the screen size and orientation</li>
  <li>Fragments have direct access to their container activity and can contribute items to the
activity's Action Bar (discussed next)</li>
</ul>

<p>To manage the fragments in your activity, you must use the {@link
android.app.FragmentManager}, which provides several APIs for interacting with fragments, such
as finding fragments in the activity and popping fragments off the back stack to restore them
after they've been removed or hidden.</p>

<p>To perform a transaction, such as add or remove a fragment, you must create a {@link
android.app.FragmentTransaction}. You can then call methods such as {@link
android.app.FragmentTransaction#add add()} {@link android.app.FragmentTransaction#remove
remove()}, or {@link android.app.FragmentTransaction#replace replace()}. Once you've applied all
the changes you want to perform for the transaction, you must call {@link
android.app.FragmentTransaction#commit commit()} and the system applies the fragment transaction to
the activity.</p>

<p>For more information about using fragments, read the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/fragments.html">Fragments</a> developer guide.</p>




<h3>Action Bar</h3>

<p>The Action Bar is a replacement for the traditional title bar at the top of the activity window.
It includes the application logo in the left corner and provides a new interface for items in the
activity's Options Menu. Additionally, the Action Bar allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include select menu items directly in the Action Bar&mdash;as "action
items"&mdash;for quick access to global user actions.
    <p>In your XML declaration for the menu item, include the attribute, {@code
android:showAsAction} with a value of {@code "ifRoom"}. When there's enough room in the
Action Bar, the menu item appears directly in the bar. Otherwise, the item is placed in the
overflow menu, revealed by the icon on the right side of the Action Bar.</p></li>

  <li>Add interactive widgets to the Action Bar&mdash;as "action views"&mdash;such as a search box.
    <p>In the XML for the menu item that should behave as an action view, include the {@code
android:actionViewLayout} attribute with a layout
resource for the action view or {@code android:actionViewClass} with the class name of the
widget. Like action items, an action view appears only when there's room for it in the Action
Bar. If there's not enough room, it is placed in the overflow menu and behaves like a regular
menu item (for example, an item can provide a {@link android.widget.SearchView} as an action
view, but when in the overflow menu, selecting the item activates the search dialog).</p></li>

  <li>Add an action to the application logo when tapped and replace it with a custom logo
    <p>The application logo is automatically assigned the {@code android.R.id.home} ID,
which the system deliveres to your activity's {@link android.app.Activity#onOptionsItemSelected
onOptionsItemSelected()} callback when tapped. Simply respond to this ID in your callback
method to perform an action such as go to your application's "home" activity.</p>
    <p>To replace the icon with a logo, </p></li>

  <li>Add breadcrumbs for navigating backward through fragments</li>
  <li>Add built in tabs and a drop-down list for navigation</li>
  <li>Customize the Action Bar themes and custom backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>The Action Bar is standard for all applications that set either the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min">{@code
android:minSdkVersion}</a> or <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target">{@code
android:targetSdkVersion}</a> to {@code "Honeycomb"}. (The "Honeycomb" API Level is provisional
and effective only while using the preview SDK&mdash;you must change it to the official API
Level when the final SDK becomes available&mdash;see <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/preview/start.html">Getting Started</a> for more information.)</p>

<p>For more information about the Action Bar, read the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html">Action
Bar</a> developer guide.</p>




<h3>System clipboard</h3>

<p>Applications can now copy and paste data (beyond mere text) to and from the system-wide
clipboard. Clipped data can be plain text, a URI, or an intent.</p>

<p>By providing the system access to your data in a content provider, the user can copy complex
content (such as an image or data structure) from your application and paste it into another
application that supports that type of content.</p>

<p>To start using the clipboard, get the global {@link android.content.ClipboardManager} object
by calling {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService getSystemService(CLIPBOARD_SERVICE)}.</p>

<p>To create an item to attach to the clipboard ("copy"), you need to create a new {@link
android.content.ClipData} object, which holds one or more {@link android.content.ClipData.Item}
objects, each describing a single entity. To create a {@link android.content.ClipData} object with
just one {@link android.content.ClipData.Item}, you can use one of the helper methods, such as
{@link android.content.ClipData#newPlainText newPlainText()}, {@link
android.content.ClipData#newUri newUri()}, and {@link android.content.ClipData#newIntent
newIntent()}, which each return a {@link android.content.ClipData} object pre-loaded with the
appropriate {@link android.content.ClipData.Item}.</p>

<p>To add the {@link android.content.ClipData} to the clipboard, pass it to {@link
android.content.ClipboardManager#setPrimaryClip setPrimaryClip()} for your instance of {@link
android.content.ClipboardManager}.</p>

<p>You can then acquire ("paste") a file from the clipboard by calling {@link
android.content.ClipboardManager#getPrimaryClip()} on the {@link
android.content.ClipboardManager}. Handling the {@link android.content.ClipData} you receive can
be more complicated and you need to be sure you can actually handle the data type.</p>

<p>For more information, see the {@link android.content.ClipData} class reference. You can also see
an example implementation of copy and paste in the <a
href="{@docRoot}resources/samples/NotePad/index.html">NotePad</a> sample application.</p>




<h3>Drag and drop</h3>

<p>New APIs facilitate the ability for your application to implement drag and drop
functionality in the UI.</p>

<p>To begin dragging content in your activity, call {@link android.view.View#startDrag startDrag()}
on a {@link android.view.View}, providing a {@link android.content.ClipData} object that represents
the information to drag, a {@link android.view.View.DragShadowBuilder} to facilitate the "shadow"
that the user sees while dragging, and an {@link java.lang.Object} that can share information about
the drag object with views that may receive the object.</p>

<p>To accept a drag object (receive the "drop") in a
{@link android.view.View}, register the view with an {@link android.view.View.OnDragListener
OnDragListener} by
calling {@link android.view.View#setOnDragListener setOnDragListener()}. When a drag event occurs on
the view, the system calls {@link android.view.View.OnDragListener#onDrag onDrag()} for the  {@link
android.view.View.OnDragListener OnDragListener}, which receives a {@link android.view.DragEvent}
describing the
type of event has occurred (such as "drag started", "drag ended", or "drop"). During a drag, the
system repeatedly calls {@link
android.view.View.OnDragListener#onDrag onDrag()} for the view underneath the drag, to
deliver a stream of events. The receiving view can
inquire the event type delivered to {@link android.view.View#onDragEvent onDragEvent()} by calling
{@link android.view.DragEvent#getAction getAction()} on the {@link android.view.DragEvent}.</p>

<p>Although a drag event may carry a {@link android.content.ClipData} object, this is not related
to the system clipboard. The data being dragged is passed as a {@link
android.content.ClipData} object to {@link android.view.View#startDrag startDrag()} and the system
sends it to the receiving {@link android.view.View} in the {@link android.view.DragEvent} sent to
{@link android.view.View.OnDragListener#onDrag onDrag()}. A drag and drop operation should never
put the dragged data in the global system clipboard.</p>



<h3>App widgets</h3>

<p>Android 3.0 supports several new widget classes for more interactive app widgets, including:
{@link
android.widget.GridView}, {@link android.widget.ListView}, {@link android.widget.StackView}, {@link
android.widget.ViewFlipper}, and {@link android.widget.AdapterViewFlipper}.</p>

<p>You can also use the new {@link android.widget.RemoteViewsService} to populate
collection views such as ({@link android.widget.GridView}, {@link android.widget.ListView}, and
{@link android.widget.StackView}).</p>

<p>{@link android.appwidget.AppWidgetProviderInfo} also supports two new fields: {@link
android.appwidget.AppWidgetProviderInfo#autoAdvanceViewId} and {@link
android.appwidget.AppWidgetProviderInfo#previewImage}. The {@link
android.appwidget.AppWidgetProviderInfo#autoAdvanceViewId} field lets you specify the view ID of the
app widget subview, which is auto-advanced by the app widget’s host. The
{@link android.appwidget.AppWidgetProviderInfo#previewImage} field specifies a preview of what the
app widget looks like and is shown to the user from the widget picker. If this field is not
supplied, the app widget's icon is used for the preview.</p>

<p>Android also provides a new widget preview tool ({@code WidgetPreview}), located in the SDK
tools, to take a screenshot of your app widget, which you can use when specifying the {@link
android.appwidget.AppWidgetProviderInfo#previewImage} field.</p>





<h3>Status bar notifications</h3>

<p>The {@link android.app.Notification} APIs have been extended to support more content-rich status
bar notifications, plus a new {@link android.app.Notification.Builder} class allows you to easily
control the notification properties.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for a large icon in the notification, using {@link
android.app.Notification.Builder#setLargeIcon setLargeIcon()}. This is usually for
social applications to show the contact photo of the person who is the source of the
notification or for media apps to show an album thumbnail.</li>
  <li>Support for custom layouts in the status bar ticker, using {@link
android.app.Notification.Builder#setTicker(CharSequence,RemoteViews) setTicker()}.</li>
  <li>Support for custom notification layouts to include buttons with {@link
android.app.PendingIntent}s, for more interactive notification widgets
(such as to control ongoing music in the background).</li>
</ul>




<h3>Content loaders</h3>

<p>New framework APIs facilitate asynchronous loading of data using the {@link
android.content.Loader} class. You can use it in combination with UI components such as views and
fragments to dynamically load data from worker threads. The {@link
android.content.CursorLoader} subclass is specially designed to help do so for data queried from
a {@link android.content.ContentResolver}.</p>





<h3>Bluetooth A2DP and headset APIs</h3>

<p>Android now includes APIs for applications to verify the state of connected Bluetooth A2DP and
headset profile devices. For example, applications can identify when a Bluetooth headset is
connected for listening to music and notify the user as appropriate. Applications can also receive
broadcasts for vendor specific AT commands and notify the user about the state of the connected
device, such as when the connected device's battery is low.</p>

<p>You can initialize the respective {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothProfile} by calling {@link
android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter#getProfileProxy getProfileProxy()} with either the {@link
android.bluetooth.BluetoothProfile#A2DP} or {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothProfile#HEADSET}
profile constant and a {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothProfile.ServiceListener} to receive
callbacks when the Bluetooth client is connected or disconnected.</p>




<h3>Animation framework</h3>

<p>An all new flexible animation framework allows you to animate arbitrary properties of any object
(View, Drawable, Fragment, Object, or anything else). It allows you to define many aspects of an
animation, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duration</li>
  <li>Repeat amount and behavior</li>
  <li>Type of time interpolation</li>
  <li>Animator sets to play animations together, sequentially, or after specified delays</li>
  <li>Frame refresh delay</li>
</ul>
  
 <p>You can define these animation aspects, and others, for an object's int, float, and hexadecimal
color values, by default.  To animate any other type of value, you tell the system how to calculate
the values for that given type, by implementing the {@link android.animation.TypeEvaluator}
interface.</p>

<p>There are two animators you can use to animate values of a property: {@link
android.animation.ValueAnimator} and {@link android.animation.ObjectAnimator}. The {@link
android.animation.ValueAnimator} computes the animation values, but is not aware of the specific
object or property that is animated as a result. It simply performs the calculations, and you must
listen for the updates and process the data with your own logic. The {@link
android.animation.ObjectAnimator} is a subclass of {@link android.animation.ValueAnimator} and
allows you to set the object and property to animate, and it handles all animation work.
That is, you give the {@link android.animation.ObjectAnimator} the object to animate, the
property of the object to change over time, and a set of values to apply to the property over
time in order to animate it, then start the animation.</p>

<p>Additionally, the {@link android.animation.LayoutTransition} class enables automatic transition
animations for changes you make to your activity layout. To enable transitions for part of the
layout, create a {@link android.animation.LayoutTransition} object and set it on
any {@link android.view.ViewGroup} by calling {@link
android.view.ViewGroup#setLayoutTransition setLayoutTransition()}. This causes default
animations to run whenever items are added to or removed from the group. To specify custom
animations, call {@link android.animation.LayoutTransition#setAnimator setAnimator()} on the {@link
android.animation.LayoutTransition} and provide a custom {@link android.animation.Animator},
such as a {@link android.animation.ValueAnimator} or {@link android.animation.ObjectAnimator}
discussed above.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/animation.html">Animation</a> developer guide.</p>




<h3>Extended UI framework</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li><b>Multiple-choice selection for ListView and GridView</b>

<p>New {@link android.widget.AbsListView#CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL} mode for {@link
android.widget.AbsListView#setChoiceMode setChoiceMode()} allows for selecting multiple items
from a {@link android.widget.ListView} and {@link android.widget.GridView}.</p>

<p>To enable multiple-choice selection, call {@link
android.widget.AbsListView#setChoiceMode setChoiceMode(CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL)} and register a
{@link android.widget.AbsListView.MultiChoiceModeListener MultiChoiceModeListener} with {@link
android.widget.AbsListView#setMultiChoiceModeListener setMultiChoiceModeListener()}.</p>

<p>When the user performs a long-press on an item, the Action Bar switches to the Multi-choice
Action Mode. The system notifies the {@link android.widget.AbsListView.MultiChoiceModeListener
MultiChoiceModeListener} when items are selected by calling {@link
android.widget.AbsListView.MultiChoiceModeListener#onItemCheckedStateChanged
onItemCheckedStateChanged()}.</p>

<p>For an example of multiple-choice selection, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/view/List15.html">List15.
java</a>
class in the API Demos sample application.</p>
  </li>

  
  <li><b>New APIs to transform views</b>
  
    <p>New APIs allow you to easily apply 2D and 3D transformations to {@link
android.view.View}s in your activity layout, using a set of object properties that define the view's
layout position, orientation, transparency and more.</p>
    <p>New methods to set properties include: {@link android.view.View#setAlpha setAlpha()}, {@link
android.view.View#setBottom setBottom()}, {@link android.view.View#setLeft setLeft()}, {@link
android.view.View#setRight setRight()}, {@link android.view.View#setBottom setBottom()}, {@link
android.view.View#setPivotX setPivotX()}, {@link android.view.View#setPivotY setPivotY()}, {@link
android.view.View#setRotationX setRotationX()}, {@link android.view.View#setRotationY
setRotationY()}, {@link android.view.View#setScaleX setScaleX()}, {@link android.view.View#setScaleY
setScaleY()}, {@link android.view.View#setAlpha setAlpha()}, and others.</p>

    <p>Some methods also have a corresponding XML attribute that you can specify in your layout
file. Available attributes include: {@code translationX}, {@code translationY}, {@code rotation},
{@code rotationX}, {@code rotationY}, {@code scaleX}, {@code scaleY}, {@code transformPivotX},
{@code transformPivotY}, and {@code alpha}.</p>

    <p>Using some of these new properties in combination with the new animation framework (discussed
previously), you can easily create some fancy animations to your views. For example, to rotate a
view on its y-axis, supply {@link android.animation.ObjectAnimator} with the {@link
android.view.View}, the "rotationY" property, and the values to use:</p>
<pre>
ObjectAnimator animator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(myView, "rotationY", 0, 360);
animator.setDuration(2000);
animator.start();
</pre>
  </li>

  
  <li><b>New holographic themes</b>

    <p>The standard system widgets and overall look have been redesigned for use on larger screens
such as tablets and incorporate the new "holographic" UI theme. The system applies these styles
using the standard <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/themes.html">style and theme</a> system.
Any application that targets the Android 3.0 platform inherits the holographic theme by default.
However, if your application also applies its own styles, then it will override the holographic
theme, unless you update your styles to inherit the holographic theme.</p>

<p>To apply the holographic theme to individual activities or to inherit them in your own theme
definitions, use one of several new {@link android.R.style#Theme_Holo Theme.Holo}
themes.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  <li><b>New widgets</b>

    <ul>
    <li>{@link android.widget.AdapterViewAnimator}
    <p>Base class for an {@link android.widget.AdapterView} that performs animations when switching
    between its views.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.AdapterViewFlipper}
    <p>Simple {@link android.widget.ViewAnimator} that animates between two or more views that have
    been added to it. Only one child is shown at a time. If requested, it can automatically flip
  between
    each child at a regular interval.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.CalendarView}
    <p>Allows users to select dates from a calendar and you can configure the range of dates
    available. A user can select a date by tapping on it and can scroll and fling
    the calendar to a desired date.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.ListPopupWindow}
    <p>Anchors itself to a host view and displays a list of choices, such as for a list of
    suggestions when typing into an {@link android.widget.EditText} view.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.NumberPicker}
    <p>Enables the user to select a number from a predefined range. The widget presents an
    input field and up and down buttons for selecting a number. Touching the input field shows a
    scroll wheel that allows the user to scroll through values or touch again to directly edit the
    current value. It also allows you to map from positions to strings, so that
    the corresponding string is displayed instead of the position index.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.PopupMenu}
    <p>Displays a {@link android.view.Menu} in a modal popup window that's anchored to a view. The
  popup
    appears below the anchor view if there is room, or above it if there is not. If the IME (soft
    keyboard) is visible, the popup does not overlap it until it is touched.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.SearchView}
    <p>Provides a search box that works in conjunction with a search provider (in the same manner as
    the traditional <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/search/search-dialog.html">search dialog</a>).
It
    also displays recent query suggestions or custom suggestions as configured by the search
    provider. This widget is particularly useful for offering search in the Action Bar.</p></li>
    
    <li>{@link android.widget.StackView}
    <p>A view that displays its children in a 3D stack and allows users to discretely swipe through
  the
    children.</p></li>
    
    </ul>
  </li>
  
</ul>




<!--
<h3>WebKit</h3>
<h3>JSON (utilities)</h3>
    -->


<h3>Graphics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Hardware accelerated 2D graphics</b>

<p>You can now enable the OpenGL renderer for your application by setting {@code
android:hardwareAccelerated="true"} in your manifest element's <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">{@code &lt;application&gt;}</a>
element or for individual <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html">{@code &lt;activity&gt;}</a>
elements.</p>

<p>This flag helps applications by making them draw faster. This results in smoother animations,
smoother scrolling, and overall better performance and response to user interaction.</p></li>


  <li><b>View support for hardware and software layers</b>
  
    <p>By default, a {@link android.view.View} has no layer specified. You can specify that the
view be backed by either a hardware or software layer, specified by values {@link
android.view.View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE} and {@link android.view.View#LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE}, using
{@link android.view.View#setLayerType setLayerType()} or the <a
href="{@docRoot}reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:layerType">{@code layerType}</a>
attribute.</p>
    <p>A hardware layer is backed by a hardware specific texture (generally Frame Buffer Objects or
FBO on OpenGL hardware) and causes the view to be rendered using Android's hardware rendering
pipeline, but only if hardware acceleration is turned on for the view hierarchy. When hardware
acceleration is turned off, hardware layers behave exactly as software layers.</p>
    <p>A software layer is backed by a bitmap and causes the view to be rendered using Android's
software rendering pipeline, even if hardware acceleration is enabled. Software layers should be
avoided when the affected view tree updates often. Every update will require to re-render the
software layer, which can potentially be slow.</p>
    <p>For more information, see the {@link android.view.View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE} and {@link
android.view.View#LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE} documentation.</p>
  </li>
  

  <li><b>Renderscript 3D graphics engine</b>

<p>Renderscript is a runtime 3D framework that provides both an API for building 3D scenes as well
as a special, platform-independent shader language for maximum performance. Using Renderscript, you
can accelerate graphics operations and data processing. Renderscript is an ideal way to create
high-performance 3D effects for applications, wallpapers, carousels, and more.</p></li>
</ul>




<h3>Media</h3>


<ul>

  <li><b>Time lapse video</b>

<p>Camcorder APIs now support the ability to record time lapse video. The {@link
android.media.MediaRecorder#setCaptureRate setCaptureRate()} sets the rate at which frames
should be captured.</p></li>

  <li><b>Texture support for image streams</b>
    
<p>New {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture} allows you to capture an image stream as an OpenGL ES
texture. By calling {@link android.hardware.Camera#setPreviewTexture setPreviewTexture()} for your
{@link android.hardware.Camera} instance, you can specify the {@link
android.graphics.SurfaceTexture} upon which to draw video playback or preview frames from the
camera.</p></li>

  <li><b>HTTP Live streaming</b>
    
<p>Applications can now pass an M3U playlist URL to the media framework to begin an HTTP Live
streaming session. The media framework supports most of the HTTP Live streaming specification,
including adaptive bit rate.</p></li>

  <li><b>EXIF data</b>
    
<p>The {@link android.media.ExifInterface} includes new fields for photo aperture, ISO, and exposure
time.</p></li>

  <li><b>Camcorder profiles</b>

<p>New {@link android.media.CamcorderProfile#hasProfile hasProfile()} method and several video
quality profiles (such as {@link android.media.CamcorderProfile#QUALITY_1080P}, {@link
android.media.CamcorderProfile#QUALITY_720P}, {@link
android.media.CamcorderProfile#QUALITY_CIF}, and others) allow you to determine camcorder
quality options.</p></li>

  <li><b>Digital media file transfer</b>

<p>The platform includes built-in support for Media/Picture Transfer Protocol (MTP/PTP) over USB,
which lets users easily transfer any type of media files between devices and to a host computer.
Developers can build on this support, creating applications that let users create or manage rich
media files that they may want to transfer or share across devices. </p></li>

  <li><b>Digital rights management (DRM)</b>

<p>New extensible digital rights management (DRM) framework for checking and enforcing digital
rights. It's implemented in two architectural layers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A DRM framework API, which is exposed to applications and runs through the Dalvik VM for
standard applications.</li>
  <li>A native code DRM manager that implements the framework API and exposes an interface for DRM
plug-ins to handle rights management and decryption for various DRM schemes.</li>
</ul>

<p>For application developers, the framework offers an abstract, unified API that simplifies the
management of protected content. The API hides the complexity of DRM operations and allows a
consistent operation mode for both protected and unprotected content, and across a variety of DRM
schemes.</p>

<p>For device manufacturers, content owners, and Internet digital media providers the DRM
framework?s plugin API provides a means of adding support for a DRM scheme of choice into the
Android system, for secure enforcement of content protection.</p>

<p>The preview release does not provide any native DRM plug-ins for checking and enforcing digital
rights. However, device manufacturers may ship DRM plug-ins with their devices.</p>

<p>You can find all of the DRM APIs in the {@link android.drm} package.</p></li>

</ul>








<h2 id="api-level">API Level</h2>

<p>The Android 3.0 platform delivers an updated version of
the framework API. Because this is a preview of the Android 3.0 API, it uses a provisional API
level of "Honeycomb", instead of an integer identifier, which will be provided when the final SDK
is made available and all APIs are final.</p>

<p>To use APIs introduced in Android 3.0 in your application, you need compile the application
against the Android library that is provided in the Android 3.0 preview SDK platform and you must
declare this API Level in your manifest as <code>android:minSdkVersion="Honeycomb"</code>, in the
<code>&lt;uses-sdk&gt;</code> element in the application's manifest.</p>

<p>For more information about using this provisional API Level and setting up your environment
to use the preview SDK, please see the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/preview/start.html">Getting
Started</a> document.</p>
